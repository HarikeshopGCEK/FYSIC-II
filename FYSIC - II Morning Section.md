# Introduction To Robotics

## What is Robotics

1. Robotics is a field that Integrates
	1. Mechanical Engineering
	2. Electronics engineering
	3. Computer Science Engineering
2. A robot is a machine capable of carrying out complex actions automatically, especially by being programmable by a computer.

### Examples

- Vacuum cleaner robot like Roomba.
- Robotics Arm used in car manufacturing
- Mars Rovers and etc.

# Why should Physics Students Care

- Physics is the foundational in Understaning
	1. Kinematics (motion)
	2. Dynamics(Forces and Torques)
	3. Electronics
	4. Control systems( Feed back, PID )

- **Example:**
- You use Newtonâ€™s laws to model robotic arm movements.
- Optics used in robot vision systems.

# Types Of Robots

- Mobile Robots ( Can move )
- Manipulators ( Stationary with moving arms )
- Humanoids ( Imitating Human Actions )
- Industrial Robots ( Manufacturing )
- Swarm Robots ( Multiple simple bots coordinating together )
